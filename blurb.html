 I love Hadieh Shafie's beautiful abstracts made of colourful cylinders of rolled-up paper. I also thought the concentric circle designs would look beautiful on a skirt! There was just a little problem. When fabric is printed, the image doesn't cover the whole length of the cloth: the image is <i>tiled</i> to fill all the space. Unfortunately, this strategy means that the boundary between one tile and the next is <i>discontinous</i> - or just <i>obvious</i> if you are not so into math.<p>Luckily, I spent four years in the company of colleagues studying the properties of circle and sphere packings, so I know how to make repeating pattern by using 'looping boundary conditions'. This means that a circle which disappears off the left side of the image will reappear on the right side. <p>I also knew that I could build a circle packing by pretending that the circles are soap bubbles. The bubbles have a little kinetic energy, so they can wander around on the canvas. And when the bubbles squish against each other, they push each other apart. I built a simulation in which I slowly reduced the surface area of the canvas so that the bubbles were obliged to rearrange and pack more efficiently. <p>It's worth observing that Shafie's circle packings, which I expect are prepared by starting at the bottom of the frame and building up layer by layer, are <i>very dense</i>. When you look at the packings, most of the canvas is covered by the circles. In two dimensions, <i>random close packing</i> (the ratio of the area filled by the circles to the area of the canvas) is about 84\%
