			<p>Kagglers were given 140 months of weekly sales data for 80-odd departments in 45 Walmart stores,

			mysterious markdowns. The goal was to predict the next 39 weeks of sales. Some of the markdown data
			was missing from the training set and the last 11 weeks of the test data was missing the unemployment

			A few departments with large sales (92 in particular) had nice period behaviour on the

			ended on a Friday, sales would be higher in a week where people were paid on a Saturday
			than on a Thursday, simply because having 6 days to shop with a flush bank account give more
			people more time to make purchases than having only one day to shop.
