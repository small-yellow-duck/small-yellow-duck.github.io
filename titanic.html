			Other folks on Kaggle had some helpful insights about which information was most

			<b><ul>Cabin</ul></b> Does knowing anything about the passengers' cabins help to predict survival?
			The cabin info consists of a letter (corresponding to a deck) and a cabin number, which is
			odd for cabins on the starboard side and even for the port.
			
			<p><p>A partial cabin list for first class passengers 
			was found on the body of a steward. Cabin information is mostly missing for second and third class passengers. If cabin 
			information is available for second and third class passengers, then usually 
			a passenger in that cabin survived. (The third class male survival rate for passengers
			with a known cabin is 0.33 (2/6) and 0.13 (45/341) for those with an unknown cabin.)

			<p><p>The "Women and Children" lifeboat policy was enforced differently on the port and starboard
			sides of the Titanic. On the starboard side men were allowed to board lifeboats if there 
			were no women or children to board, while on the port side only women and children were 
			allowed to board. Does this rule affect the survival of male passengers
			in First Class?

			<b>Survival of family members</b>
			<p><p>
			The training data set constitutes about 2/3 of all the passenger data. Since the survival
			of individuals is correlated to the survival of family members, knowing which
			passengers in the training data set survived or died can be used to predict which
			passengers in the test data survived.
			<p>
			<p>I created two additional variables: "family member survived" [yes, unknown] and "family
			member died [yes, unknown]. More complicated measures such as "Mr in family survived/died" 
			caused the model to overfit.

			It's pretty easy to make a simple model which uses the Title, Class and Family size to
			predict whether a particular passenger lived or died. It's also pretty easy to make the
			model more complicated by including other factors (age, ticket price, embarkation point).
			<b>But it's much harder to determine whether a more complicated model is over-fitting the
			data.</b>
			
			<p>There are two criteria for comparing different models: the difference between
			the accuracy (ie the fraction of correct outcomes) in the training and test data, and the variability
			in the accuracy when the model is created and applied to different subsets of the
			training and test data. I estimated the accuracy and the variability in the accuracy by using <b>cross validation</b>: fitting the model to a subset of the training data, then
			testing the model on the remaining data. Randomly sampling different fractions of the
			training data helps to clarify if the model becomes less powerful as the size of the 
			training sample increases. And comparing the score on the training data to the score
			on the testing data helps to determine whether the model is over-fitting.
