			<p>The most useful features I identified were: the median time between a user's bid and that user's previous bid,
			the mean number of bids a user made per auction, the entropy for how many bids a user placed on each day of the

			<table>
			
			<tr>
			<td  valign=top width=350>  
			<b><ul>A sample auction</ul></b> Examining the bidding activity in one auction suggested a few useful features
			right off the bat. I was a little unlucky with first auction I picked: one bidder made about 800 bids and completely
			dominated the auction. Must be a bot, eh? So the mean number of bids per auction, <tt>bids_per_auction_mean</tt> is 
			probably instructive. What about the time between a user's bid and the previous bid in a given auction? 
			(<tt>dt_others_median</tt>). How rapidly does the user place subsequent bids (in the same auction or a different
			auction)? (<tt>dt_self_median</tt>). How rapidly does a user switch between IPs (in the same auction or a different
			auction)? (<tt>dt_change_ip_median</tt>)
			
			<p><p>Another useful observation is that users which place bids from multiple countries often only place bids from
			one country in a given auction - this suggests that multiple people may be placing bids from the same account, but
			that only one individual on the account usually follows any one auction.

			Instead of having one continuous chunk of bidding action, there are three chunks.

			<tr valign=top width=900>
			<td  valign=top width=900>  
			<p><p>In the bids/unit time histogram, each of the three chunks contains about three periods worth of
			bidding activity, which suggests that each chunk of data is probably three days. The durations 
			of each chunk are the same (+/- 1 mystery unit) and the durations of the gaps between each chunk are also the same, which
			suddenly made it very easy to calculate the length of a day. The duration of the
			entire data set is 31 times <tt>one_day</tt>. Had the data chunks not all been so suggestively
			the same duration, the positions of peaks in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation">
			autocorrelation function</a> of the bid histogram could have been used to calculate the length of a day.

			<b><ul>Characterizing the distribution of times at which users place bids</ul></b>
			Both the histograms of bids over time for all the auctions and bids over time for single auctions
			exhibited a periodicity of one day - and this periodicity was more obvious for human bidders than
			for bots. (This is to be expected as humans sleep.) There was also a daily spike in human bidding activity, 
			which was puzzling (did all auctions
			end at midnight GMT? Was this just the busiest time of day for bidders in Asia?) Nevertheless, the variation in the number of bids as a function of 
			the time of day was a feature that could be exploited using a simple histogram. What fraction of a user's bids
			were placed in the first 30 minutes of the day? The second 30 minutes? A second measure is the ratio between
			the number of bids placed in the first/second/n 30 minutes of the day and the number of bids in the 30 minute segment 
			in which the most bids were placed. Both these measures gave similar improvements to the
			classification (see below for comments on cross-validation). 
			
			<p><p>It would be reasonable to expect to need to shift the bids/time histogram along the time axis depending on what
			time zone the bidder was in. This is tricky though, since IP is not a reliable indicator of location. And the
			daily spike in human bidding activity suggested that shifting the bids/time histogram might not actually be
			very instructive.

			<p><b><ul>Bidding strategy over the course of an auction</ul></b>
			<td valign=top align=left width=450> 		
			Because the data is in three chunks, it's impossible to tell if there are any complete auctions - if the 
			first bid in the data set is sufficiently far from <tt>t_start</tt>, then it's reasonable to assume that this was the first bid in 
			the auction (ditto for the last bid, where the last bid falls reasonable far from the end of the data set). I would have liked to have created a description of the bidding strategy which included where in the
			auction a user was bidding - did the user bid only at the last minute? Or only in the beginning of an 
			auction? These behaviours correspond to two different bot strategies: the first bot exists to drive up the
			price, while the second bot is designed to rapidly make a lot of bids to finish the auction. However, there
			were no clues in the bidding data to suggest that any of the auctions were complete.

				<h2>Using entropy to characterize variety in weekday, IP, referring URL</h2>
			</div>
	
			<table>
			<tr>
			<td valign=top width = 900> 
			One way to characterize the variation in how bids were placed is the entropy. 
			A concrete example of the entropy is the IP entropy: N!/(N_<sub>IP1</sub>! 
			N<sub>IP2</sub>!... N<sub>IPn</sub>!). N is the total number of bids and N_<sub>IPn</sub> 
			is the total number of bids placed from the nth IP. The entropy is a measure 
			of how both randomly distributed the bids are, how many IPs there 
			are and how many bids there are. A bidder that places all their bids from the same 
			IP has an entropy of N!/N! = 1. Because the entropy is very large, it is smarter to 
			calculate the log of the entropy. 
			
			<p><p>Entropy also turned out to be a useful way to characterize how a user's 
			bidding activity is distributed over each of the three days of the week as well as
			over the referring URLs.

				<h2>Other useful features</h2>

			<table><tr>
			<td valign=top align=left width=900>
			The model got additional mileage out of the fraction of bids a user place in
			each of the 199 countries, as well as the fraction of IPs from which a user
			placed a bid from which another user who was a bot also placed a bid.
			</td></tr>
			</table>
			<table>
			<td valign=top align=left width=450>
			<b><ul>Auction duration</ul></b>
			Some of the auctions only had bidding activity in one of the three-day chunks, while other auctions included
			bidding activity in two of the chunks - ie, some of the auctions lasted at least 17 days. It turned out that the
			durations of auctions which the bidder participated in was slightly helpful in labeling bots. What fraction of
			the auctions the user participated in were longer than two weeks? What was the median time between the user's  
			bids and the start of the auction? The median time between a user's bids and the end of an auction?
			
			<p><p>I was really stumped about why there were hardly any bids placed by robots between 11 and 14 days before 
			the end of the auction. I wondered if this behaviour might have helped to explain why we only got to see three
			days out of every two weeks in the data....

			<b><ul>Assessing the quality of predictions</ul></b>
			There was a lot of variation in the data set, so quantifying the performance of the classifier was difficult.
			I used 100 splits (80%-train, 20%-validation) to cross-validate the predictions and then examined the 10th
			percentile and 25th percentile score. Ultimately, this was helpful up until the last 0.003 or so. I typically
			found that my leaderboard score was about 0.008 less than the scores I was getting for the 25th percentile 
			for my cross-validation.

			<b><ul>Weekly bidder entropy</b></ul>				
			In the training data, a larger fraction of bids by humans takes place in the first data chunk (week0)

			<td valign=top align=left width=800>		
			<b><ul>Using a cluster algorithm to group users which use similar sets of IPs</b></ul>
			I used <tt>MiniBatchKMeans</tt> to cluster users according to the fraction of bids they placed on IPs that
			occur more than twice. I was hoping to identify users with multiple accounts. Clustering was computationally
			expensive and didn't add anything measurable when tested using cross-validation.
			
			<p><b><ul>Feature-weighted linear stacking</b></ul>
			Using <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.0460.pdf">feature-weighted linear stacking</a> to blend the results of several 
			different models didn't produce results any better than <tt>RandomForestClassifier</tt>. In FWLS, the training data
			is broken into several folds and predictions for different models are generated for each fold. FWLS probably
			did not work very well because 
			variation between the scores for predictions of a single model on different folds is quite large and 
			because <tt>RandomForestClassifier</tt> exploited slightly different features every time the model was fitted on
			a different fold.
 		
			<p><b><ul>Using <tt>payment_account</tt> and <tt>address</tt> data</ul></b>
			Again, I was hoping to exploit users who were placing bids with multiple accounts. Let's take a look at the 
			first few lines of train.csv - the file which contains bidder info, along with the outcome
			(whether the bidder is a human or a robot).
