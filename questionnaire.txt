-What made you participate in the competition?
When I started out I just wanted to take a break from another project - there were three weeks left in the competition and that sounded like the right amount of time for me to make some progress....

-What is it about Facebook that excites you?
I expect that Facebook probably has problems that are both worthwhile and challenging - as well as the technical infrastructure, people and environment for implementing really cutting-edge solutions to those problems. I also know that I would learn a lot from an environment where I can pick up some more sophisticated database skills.

In the past year I've gotten really excited about using neural networks to do image segmentation, so I'm pretty curious about the "friend tagger". I've been collecting "friend tagger" fails. I sewed a shirt from fabric that I designed myself (with a bit of help from machine learning - http://small-yellow-duck.github.io/circles/shirt.html) and the design has proven hilariously effective at confusing the friend tagger. So I have some ideas about how to create passive feedback on whether the friend tagger has tagged somebody correctly. I would love any excuse to learn more about neural networks.

If I worked at Facebook I'd also be interested in working on sock-puppet detection and account fraud. And I'm curious about investigating how people with limited computer skills or internet access use (and learn to use) Facebook. People love keeping in touch with friends and family and I think Facebook is in a pretty unique position to help people learn how to use the internet and to learn how to access all the resources that are out there.

I'm also pretty open to hearing about what sorts of data-related questions Facebook would like answered. My attitude is that many problems are interesting and worthwhile and that I will learn whatever tools happen to be necessary for tackling those problems.

-What project on your resume are you most proud of and why?
 During my PhD I spent three months working on an experiment in another research group. The group had rigged up an air hockey table with 150 pucks and they had a high speed camera that they could use to track the position and velocity of each puck. I had a great idea for an experiment, so I convinced the professor to let me visit her lab (and persuaded my PhD supervisor to pay for the adventure). The experiment was pretty much "Do air hockey pucks follow the same laws of statistical mechanics that gas molecules do?" The experimental results had a subtle interpretation which I was very excited about. And I was very proud that I germinated an experiment, persuaded other people that the idea was exciting, implemented/adapted the software and hardware I needed to make the measurements and then also came up with a very insightful interpretation of the results. (http://small-yellow-duck.github.io/airhockey.html)

My favourite Kaggle problem was the seizure detection challenge. (http://small-yellow-duck.github.io/seizure_detection.html) This problem was the first time I tried using neural networks. I approached the problem by converting EEG signals from people's brains into images and very naively feeding them to a pre-trained neural network. I was totally blown away by the effectiveness of the neural network package.

I like to do artsy-fartsy projects too. I like that I can use art to show non-programmers what sort of process I go through when I break down a problem and write a program to solve it. Two years ago a Dutch organization (setup.nl) ran competition to write a computer program to fake a famous painting by Piet Mondrian - I built this: http://www.victory-boogie-woogie.appspot.com/. Now my artwork is in the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague!


-What would your ideal position look like?  What would you be doing day to day?
I like to have a few little projects going that are sort of my own part of bigger problems that a team is working on. I enjoy being handed data and just being asked to dig around and make sense of it, to create insights that are useful. I also really enjoy the satisfaction of being able to help other people formulate problems and design experiments and create metrics to answer their questions. I also really appreciate having nice colleagues who are happy to share their expertise.

-What programming languages are you proficient in?
Python.

-Are you currently interviewing with other companies?
Yes, but nobody is in a big hurry.

-Do you have any deadlines or time constraints we should be aware of?
No deadlines. I have travel plans around the second weekend in July.

-Do you know anyone who currently works at Facebook?
No.

-Do you have the legal right to work in the United States?
No. I am a Canadian citizen. My understanding is that I am eligible for TN status or an H1B.

-Which Facebook office would you be interested in?
Vancouver or Menlo Park.

 -What is your availability for a 45 minute phone interview?
I'm typically quite flexible during normal work hours (pacific time). If possible, I prefer skype or gchat.
